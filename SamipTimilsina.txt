# Git and Github training and my experience
Hello I am Samip Timilsina (email: timi.samip@gmail.com). 
The 3 days of Git and Github training was really interesting and fruitful. We were taught about the basics of the Git and Github and provided with assignments to test and recall our sessions.
Near the end, a quiz contest was conducted which made learning even more fun and at end of each questions, revisions were done at each mistake.
Honestly, with all the negative talks about online classes and trainings going around, I hadn't expected too much but joining this training has changed my perception about online classes and trainings.
However, I felt the training was short because I was enjoying it much. If in near future any advanced trainings on Git and Github are provided then I am always already.
Our trainer Milan Thapa sir taught us really well. I would understand his teachings as he provided examples and frequently revised on the earlier portions. I would find it hard to understand my lecturers
on my universites however this training taught me better than my university teachers. I would like to thank the GCA team and hope similar workshops are conducted in the near future.
